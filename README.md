# Machine-Learning-Model-Building---Regression-Classification

# 1. Laptop Price Prediction using Regression Models

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to predict the price of laptops based on their hardware specifications such as processor, RAM, storage, and other features.

This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end regression machine learning workflow including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Models Used
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- XGBoost Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

This project highlights the comparison of multiple regression models to identify the best-performing approach for price prediction.


# 2. Personality Detection using Classification Models

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting personality types based on behavioral and demographic data using supervised machine learning classification techniques.

The notebook covers the complete classification pipeline including:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison across multiple classifiers

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

This project demonstrates how different classification algorithms perform on personality prediction tasks and helps identify the most effective model.
